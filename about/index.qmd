title: "Who am I"
---

  I am **Harsha Chamara Hewage**, a PhD candidate at **Cardiff Business School** (Data Lab for Social Good). My research sits at the intersection of machine learning, time‑series forecasting and healthcare supply chains. I design methods to estimate true demand under censored observations (stockouts & service interruptions) and translate those estimates into inventory policies that improve availability of essential health commodities.

I work closely with supervisors and collaborators across academia and practice, and I enjoy building reproducible forecasting pipelines (R/Quarto/Git/Docker), delivering hands‑on training, and translating technical research into operational guidance for supply chain practitioners.

## Education

* **PhD**, Cardiff Business School — Machine Learning & Forecasting for Healthcare Supply Chains (ongoing)
* **[Previous degree(s) — add details if you want]**
  
## Research focus / PhD project
  
  My research focuses on addressing inefficiencies in supply chain management for contraceptive products in developing countries. These inefficiencies often lead to shortages, limiting women's reproductive autonomy and exacerbating societal challenges. By integrating probabilistic forecasting with inventory optimization, I aim to create a novel approach that accounts for uncertainties, poor data quality, and local demand variations. This interdisciplinary project involves collaboration with scholars from Cardiff Business School, the School of Computer Science & Informatics, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The goal is to improve access to contraceptives, reduce unintended pregnancies, and prevent unsafe abortions, ultimately benefiting women, healthcare providers, governments, and donor organizations.
