  description: >
    We study judgmental forecast adjustments in pre-promotional (normal), promotional and post-promotional periods via behavioral experiments. Forecasters need structured support to make effective adjustments during post-promotional periods. The provision of quantitative information can reduce harmful judgmental adjustments in a post-promotional period.
