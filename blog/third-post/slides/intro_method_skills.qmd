# Philosophical foundations

## Ontology

- `Ontology` – concerns the nature of reality and what we believe exists.
- `Asks`: What is real? Do social phenomena have an existence independent of our perception?
- `Realist vs. relativist ontologies`: a single objective reality vs. multiple socially constructed realities.

## Epistemology

- `Epistemology` – concerns knowledge and how we can know about reality.
- `Asks`: What counts as acceptable knowledge? Can we obtain objective truth or only subjective understandings?
- Positivist epistemology seeks observable, measurable evidence, while interpretivist epistemology emphasizes understanding meanings in context.

## Axiology

- `Axiology` – the study of values; examines the role of researchers’ values and ethics in research.
- Considers issues of right and wrong, what is worth researching, and the value judgments we bring to research.
- Influences how we interpret findings and what we see as important (e.g., a researcher’s personal and cultural values can shape research focus).

# Research paradigms

## What is a `research paradigm`?

- A `research paradigm` is a worldview or basic set of beliefs that guides how research is conducted.
- It influences what should be studied, how it should be studied, and how results are interpreted.
- Major paradigms include positivism, post-positivism, interpretivism (constructivism), critical (realism), pragmatism, and postmodern/post-structural paradigms.

## Paradigm – Positivism

- `Positivism` – assumes an objective reality that can be measured. Advocates applying natural science methods to study social phenomena.
- Seeks causal relationships and generalizable laws; uses testable hypotheses and focuses on observable facts (not subjective opinions).
- Positivist research aims to be value-free and objective, with the researcher as a neutral observer.

## Paradigm – Interpretivism

- `Interpretivism` – assumes reality is socially constructed and subjective, with multiple valid perspectives.
- Emphasizes understanding the meanings and context of human experiences rather than finding universal laws. Research is often qualitative and contextual.
- Researchers recognize their own role and values in the process; reflexivity is encouraged to understand how interpretations are formed.

## Paradigm – Critical Realism

- `Critical Realism` – a post-positivist paradigm acknowledging an independent reality that exists, but our understanding of it is inevitably imperfect.
- Distinguishes between the “real” (underlying structures) and the “observable”; unobservable mechanisms cause observable events.
- Uses theory to identify underlying social structures or mechanisms. Bridges positivism and interpretivism by accepting an external reality but viewing knowledge of it as theory-laden.

## Paradigm – Pragmatism

- `Pragmatism` – focuses on what works in practice. Truth is viewed as what is useful in answering the research question.
- Rejects strict either/or choices between paradigms: methods and concepts are chosen for their practical usefulness rather than adherence to a single philosophy.
- Often underpins mixed methods research: quantitative and qualitative approaches are combined to provide actionable knowledge from multiple perspectives.

## Paradigm – Post-Structuralism

- `Post-Structuralism` – a critical paradigm (related to postmodernism) that questions stable structures and universal truths.
- Argues that meaning and knowledge are not fixed; they are constructed through language, discourse, and power relations, and thus can be deconstructed.
- Challenges assumptions about reality and truth, highlighting how perspectives are influenced by culture, language, and power dynamics.

## Activity – Locating your paradigm

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)
```


- Think-Pair-Share: What discipline or field are you in? Discuss which research paradigm(s) are common in your field.
- Are there taken-for-granted assumptions about what should be studied, how to study it, and what counts as evidence in your field?

# Principles

## Principle – Objectivity

- `Objectivity` – maintaining impartiality and avoiding personal biases when conducting research.
- Researchers strive to observe and report facts as they are, independent of their own beliefs or values.
- In practice, complete objectivity is challenging, especially in social research – awareness of potential bias is crucial.

## Principles – Validity & Reliability

- `Validity` – the extent to which a study or measurement actually measures what it intends to measure (accuracy/truthfulness of findings).
- `Reliability` – the consistency or repeatability of results; a reliable study yields similar results under consistent conditions.
- A study should aim to be both valid and reliable – e.g., a survey that consistently gives the same result is reliable, but it must also measure the right concept to be valid.

## Principle – Reflexivity

- `Reflexivity` – the practice of reflecting on how the researcher’s own beliefs, experiences, and biases influence the research.
- Acknowledges that researchers are part of the social world they study, rather than completely objective outsiders.
- Reflexive research involves being transparent about one’s positionality and how it may shape data collection, analysis, and interpretations.

## Principle – Ethics

- `Research Ethics` – guidelines for the responsible conduct of research, defining what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior with participants and data.
- Key ethical principles: informed consent, avoiding harm to participants, confidentiality and privacy, honesty and integrity in data and analysis.
- Ethical research ensures the rights and well-being of participants are protected and that the knowledge gained is trustworthy.

## Activity – Ethics scenario

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)
```

- Imagine you are conducting interviews on a sensitive topic (e.g., mental health). How would you ensure your study is ethical?

# Research types

## Quantitative research

- `Quantitative research` – deals with numerical data and statistics to test hypotheses and examine relationships.
- Typically seeks generalizable results and causal explanations; often associated with positivist approaches (aims for objectivity and measurement).
- *Example*: measuring class size and test scores across schools to see if smaller classes lead to higher performance (data analyzed statistically).

## Qualitative research

- `Qualitative research` – deals with non-numerical data (words, observations) to understand concepts, experiences, or social contexts in depth.
- Produces rich, detailed insights rather than broad generalizations; often aligned with interpretivist approaches (understanding meanings in context).
- *Example*: interviewing teachers and students to explore how classroom size affects their experiences and learning, gathering in-depth narratives.

## Mixed methods

- `Mixed methods` – integrates both quantitative and qualitative approaches in one study to address a question from multiple angles.
- Combines numerical data with narrative data to provide a more comprehensive understanding and to corroborate findings across methods.
- *Example*: studying climate change adaptation by analyzing climate data (quantitative) and interviewing community members (qualitative) to merge scientific and local perspectives.

## Methodology vs. Methods

- `Methodology` – the overall strategy or research design guiding how you investigate a problem (the logic of inquiry) (E.g., experimental, survey, ethnography, case study).
- `Methods` – the specific techniques or procedures for data collection and analysis (the tools) (E.g., questionnaires, interviews, observations, statistical analysis).
- **Remember**: _methodology is why and how you’re doing the research (at a strategic level), whereas methods are what you actually do to collect and analyze data._

## Example – Poor housing design

- `Scenario`: A report claims many new houses suffer from “poor design.” How might researchers study this issue differently based on their paradigm?
- `Ontology`: Is “poor design” a measurable fact (objective criteria) or a concept defined by stakeholders’ perceptions (subjective)?
- `Epistemology`: Should we gain knowledge by measuring design features (collect facts) or by understanding what “poor design” means to residents and designers (interpret meanings)?
- `Methods`: A positivist approach might survey homes against design quality criteria & quantify residents’ satisfaction. An interpretivist approach might conduct interviews or focus groups to explore how people perceive and discuss “poor design”.

## Activity – Plan a study

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00)
```

- Choose a research question of interest (e.g., “How does social media use affect academic performance?”).
- What research approach would you use (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed) and why? What paradigm might this align with? 
- Identify one or two specific methods you would use to collect data, and explain how these methods fit your research question and paradigm.

## Wrapping up

- Methodological skills involve making informed choices at each stage of research – from philosophical stance to data collection methods.
- No single paradigm or method is “best” for all questions. The goal is to align your approach with your research question and objectives, and to be able to justify your choices.
- Understanding these foundations helps you critically evaluate others’ research and conduct your own studies in a rigorous, reflective, and ethical manner.
